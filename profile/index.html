            <p>I have loved technology since I was a little girl, my first approach to something related to coding was when I was a teenager. I've created static HTML websites on the now defunct Adobe GoLive. Additionally, I've set up discussion boards focused on political matters.</p>

<p> Still, I've always been much better in arts than in maths, which demotivated me to study some IT career. Instead I chose Design in Visual Communication, where I had my second foray into programming, this time in Flash ActionScript. For instance, I developed games and interactive elements. The interaction netwen humans and computers fascinated me and the way that one can mix artistic expression in an interactive program. Unfortunately (or fortunately), technological evolution lead to the demise of Adobe Flash and then I became acquainted with JavaScript and its endless possibilities. I've also worked in improvised initiatives in my country, participating in an educational coding group called “Freeduc” and experimenting with communal learning.</p>

<p>
I’ve been working as freelance doing brand, illustration and stationary. I've continuously strived to gain and improve my knowledge on all relevant web technologies, at both a theoretical as well as a technical level. I've first studied HTML and CSS on a website called “TreeHouse” and on the “Learn Code Academy” Youtube channel. </p>
<p>
I would like to get a place in Founders and Coders as it will afford me the perfect opportunity to become a skillful developer.</p>
<p>
Besides my fascination with technology, growing up in a low income neighbourhood in Santiago de Chile, in a very misogynist culture where a massive pay gap between men and women still exists and the number of women working in IT (and women working in general) leaves a lot to be desired, motivated me to help brining about much needed change, with a view to teaching coding to girls in the future and make the workplace fairer, because I really believe that technology has the effect of empowering women , girls and yield significative social changes.
